# World-Happiness-Report-project-
Letâ€™s create a real-world data analytics project using a dataset from the World Happiness Report. This project will analyze factors that contribute to happiness scores across countries and build a predictive model to estimate happiness scores based on key features.

What factors contribute to a country's happiness score, and can we predict happiness scores based on these factors?

Dataset:
The World Happiness Report dataset is available on Kaggle. It includes metrics like GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption.
