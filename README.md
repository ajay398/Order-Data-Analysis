Step 1: Understand the Dataset
Review the Structure
The dataset provided is a CSV file named Order_Data_meriskill.csv. It contains 17 columns and 1,000 rows of order data. Here's a breakdown of the columns:

OrderID: Unique identifier for each order.

Region: Geographic region of the order (e.g., Northwest, Southwest, Australia).

Country: Country where the order was placed.

CustID: Unique identifier for the customer.

Customer_Name: Name of the customer.

ProductSKU: SKU of the product ordered.

Product_Category: Category of the product (all entries are "Plants").

OrderLineItem: Line item number in the order.

OrderQuantity: Quantity of the product ordered.

ProductCost: Cost of the product.

ProductPrice: Price of the product.

OrderDate: Date of the order.

AcquisitionSource: Source through which the customer was acquired (e.g., Google-ads, Meta-ads).

TransactionID: Unique identifier for the transaction.

Fraud: Boolean indicating whether the transaction was fraudulent.

PaymentMethod: Method of payment (e.g., CREDITCARD, PAYPAL).

CardType: Type of card used (e.g., VISA, MC, AMEX).

Gender: Gender of the customer (mostly "M" for male, with some missing or "X" values).

Observations:
Data Types: Most columns are categorical (e.g., Region, Country, ProductSKU), while others are numerical (e.g., ProductCost, ProductPrice).

Missing Values: Some rows have missing values in columns like CardType and Gender.

Outliers: No obvious outliers are visible in the numerical columns, but further analysis is needed.

Inconsistencies: The Gender column has some entries marked as "X" or missing, which may need to be addressed.

Define Your Goals
The primary goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns in the data. Additionally, we can explore:

Customer Segmentation: Based on region, acquisition source, or purchase behavior.

Fraud Detection: Analyze the Fraud column to identify patterns in fraudulent transactions.

Sales Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time, by region, or by product.

Step 2: Clean and Preprocess the Data
Data Cleaning
Handle Missing Values:

For CardType and Gender, we can fill missing values with "Unknown" or drop rows with missing values if they are insignificant.

For numerical columns like ProductCost and ProductPrice, ensure there are no missing values.

Convert Data Types:

Convert OrderDate to a datetime format for time-based analysis.

Ensure OrderQuantity, ProductCost, and ProductPrice are numeric.

Remove Duplicates:

Check for duplicate rows based on OrderID and remove them if necessary.

Remove Unnecessary Columns:

Columns like TransactionID may not be useful for analysis and can be dropped.

Transform Data
Encode Categorical Variables:

Use one-hot encoding or label encoding for categorical variables like Region, Country, and PaymentMethod.

Create New Features:

Calculate the profit for each order: Profit = ProductPrice - ProductCost.

Create a Month or Year column from OrderDate for time-based analysis.

Step 3: Explore the Data
Initial Analysis
Summary Statistics:

Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns like ProductCost, ProductPrice, and OrderQuantity.

Visualizations:

Use histograms to visualize the distribution of ProductCost and ProductPrice.

Create bar charts to show the number of orders by Region or AcquisitionSource.

Use a time series plot to analyze sales trends over time.

Correlation and Insights
Correlation Matrix:

Calculate the correlation between numerical columns like ProductCost, ProductPrice, and OrderQuantity.

Fraud Analysis:

Analyze the distribution of fraudulent transactions by Region, PaymentMethod, or CardType.

Step 4: Perform Simulations
Choose the Right Model
Customer Segmentation:

Use K-means clustering to segment customers based on their purchase behavior (e.g., total spending, frequency of orders).

Fraud Detection:

Use logistic regression or decision trees to classify transactions as fraudulent or not based on features like PaymentMethod, CardType, and Region.

Sales Forecasting:

Use time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA or Prophet) to predict future sales based on historical data.

Test Your Model
Split Data:

Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

Evaluate Performance:

For classification tasks (e.g., fraud detection), use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

For regression tasks (e.g., sales forecasting), use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

Step 5: Iterate and Improve
Tune Your Model
Cross-Validation:

Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the optimal hyperparameters for your model.

Compare Models
Model Comparison:

Compare the performance of different models (e.g., logistic regression vs. decision trees for fraud detection) and choose the best one based on performance metrics.

Step 6: Present Your Findings
Visualize Results
Charts and Graphs:

Use bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to visualize key insights (e.g., sales by region, fraud distribution by payment method).

Dashboards:

Create a dashboard using tools like Tableau or Power BI to present your findings interactively.

Conclude and Propose Solutions
Key Insights:

Summarize the main findings from your analysis (e.g., regions with the highest sales, most common payment methods for fraudulent transactions).

Propose Solutions:

Based on your findings, propose actionable solutions (e.g., increase marketing efforts in high-performing regions, implement stricter fraud detection measures for certain payment methods)
